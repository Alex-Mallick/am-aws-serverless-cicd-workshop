# CI/CD for Serverless Applications

In this workshop, you will learn how to start a new Serverless application from scratch using the
AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) and how to fully automate builds and deployments.
You will use a feature of SAM called SAM Pipelines to bootstrap a continous delivery pipeline. You
will also learn how to run a serverless application locally using the SAM CLI.
